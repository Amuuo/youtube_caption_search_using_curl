[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]</text><text start="38.8" dur="2.16">No, but seriously, though, it is.</text><text start="40.96" dur="11.28">I mean, it&amp;#39;s very strange in some sense that there&amp;#39;s so many of you here to listen to a sequence of lectures on the psychological significance of the Biblical stories.</text><text start="52.32" dur="9.8">It&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve wanted to do for a long time, but it still does surprise me that there&amp;#39;s a ready audience for it.</text><text start="63.22" dur="4.22">So that&amp;#39;s good, so we&amp;#39;ll see how it goes.</text><text start="68.92" dur="2.36">I&amp;#39;ll start with this because this is the right question.</text><text start="71.28" dur="2.44">The right question is why bother doing this.</text><text start="73.72" dur="2.66">And I don&amp;#39;t mean why should I bother doing it.</text><text start="76.52" dur="7.22">I have my own reasons for doing it, but you might think, well, why bother with this strange, old book at all?</text><text start="84.5" dur="0.5">And...</text><text start="88.18" dur="1.3">That&amp;#39;s a good question.</text><text start="89.76" dur="0.5">You know,</text><text start="90.48" dur="0.5">Umm</text><text start="92.7" dur="1.64">It&amp;#39;s a contradictory...</text><text start="95.8" dur="3.5">document that&amp;#39;s been cobbled together over thousands of years.</text><text start="99.32" dur="3.58">It&amp;#39;s outlasted kingdoms, many,  many kingdoms, you know?</text><text start="103.08" dur="4.96">It&amp;#39;s very interesting, it turns out that a book is more durable than stone.</text><text start="108.04" dur="1.5">It&amp;#39;s more durable than a castle.</text><text start="109.54" dur="1.52">It&amp;#39;s more durable than an empire.</text><text start="111.4" dur="2.16">And that&amp;#39;s really interesting.</text><text start="114.18" dur="5.2">That something, in some sense, so evanescent, can be so long living.</text><text start="120.62" dur="2.3">So there&amp;#39;s that, that&amp;#39;s kind of a mystery.</text><text start="123.04" dur="7.62">I&amp;#39;m approaching this whole scenario, this Biblical stories as if they&amp;#39;re a mystery, fundamentally.</text><text start="130.66" dur="3.38">Because they are, there&amp;#39;s a lot we don&amp;#39;t understand about them.</text><text start="134.04" dur="5.76">We don&amp;#39;t understand how they came about. We don&amp;#39;t really understand how they were put together.</text><text start="140.52" dur="4.9">We don&amp;#39;t understand why they had such an unbelievable impact on civilization.</text><text start="145.82" dur="2.78">We don&amp;#39;t understand how people could have believed them.</text><text start="148.92" dur="5.6">We don&amp;#39;t understand what it means that we don&amp;#39;t believe them now, or even what it would mean if we did believe them.</text><text start="154.52" dur="10.26">And then, on top of all that, there&amp;#39;s the additional problem, which isn&amp;#39;t specific to me, but is certainly relevant to me,</text><text start="164.78" dur="8.16">that no matter how educated you are, you&amp;#39;re not educated enough to discuss the psychological significance of the Biblical stories.</text><text start="173.24" dur="2.84">But I&amp;#39;m going to do my best.</text><text start="177.2" dur="8.66">Partly because I want to learn more about them, and one of the things I&amp;#39;ve learned is that the best way to learn about something is to talk about it.</text><text start="185.86" dur="6.16">And when I&amp;#39;m lecturing, I&amp;#39;m thinking, you know, I&amp;#39;m not trying to tell you what I know for sure to be the case.</text><text start="192.02" dur="3.36">Because there&amp;#39;s lots of things I don&amp;#39;t know for sure to be the case.</text><text start="195.38" dur="2.22">I&amp;#39;m trying to make sense out of this.</text><text start="197.6" dur="2.32">And I have been doing this for a long time.</text><text start="200.78" dur="2.82">Now, you may know, you may not,</text><text start="204.46" dur="1.8">that I&amp;#39;m an admirer of Nietzsche.</text><text start="207.44" dur="5.12">Nietzsche was a devastating critic of, I would say, dogmatic Christianity.</text><text start="212.6" dur="3.68">Christianity as it was instantiated in institutions.</text><text start="216.28" dur="3.62">As opposed... although he&amp;#39;s a very paradoxical thinker.</text><text start="220" dur="7.68">For example, one of the things Nietzsche said was that he didn&amp;#39;t believe that the scientific revolution would have ever got off the ground</text><text start="228.24" dur="1.86">if it hadn&amp;#39;t been for Christianity.</text><text start="230.12" dur="8.08">And more specifically, for Catholicism because he believed that over the course of, really, a thousand years,</text><text start="239.4" dur="12.3">the European mind, so to speak, had to train itself to interpret everything that was known within a single, coherent framework.</text><text start="252.08" dur="2.58">Coherent if you accept the initial axioms.</text><text start="254.8" dur="1.88">A single coherent framework.</text><text start="256.82" dur="13.88">So Nietzsche believed that that Catholicization of the phenomena of life and of history produced the kind of mind that was then capable of transcending its dogmatic foundations</text><text start="270.7" dur="2.04">and then concentrating on something else.</text><text start="272.74" dur="3.04">Which, in this particular case, happened to be the natural world.</text><text start="275.94" dur="10.88">And so Nietzsche believed that, in some sense, that Christianity died at its own hand that spent a very long period of time trying to attune people to the necessity of the truth.</text><text start="287.66" dur="4.56">Absent corruption and all of that, that&amp;#39;s always part of any human endeavor.</text><text start="292.62" dur="6.28">And then the truth, the spirit of the truth that was developed by Christianity turned on the roots of Christianity.</text><text start="298.9" dur="5.8">And everyone woke up and said or thought something like, &amp;quot;Well how is it that we came to believe any of this?&amp;quot;</text><text start="306.34" dur="4.88">It&amp;#39;s like waking up one day and noting that you really don&amp;#39;t know why you put the Christmas tree up.</text><text start="311.22" dur="6.66">You&amp;#39;d been doing it for a long time, and that&amp;#39;s what people do, you know, and there are reasons that Christmas trees came about.</text><text start="318.98" dur="6.18">But the ritual lasts long after the reasons have been forgotten.</text><text start="325.66" dur="12.5">So, now Nietzsche, although he was a critic of Christianity, and also a champion of its disciplinary capacity, because you see, the other thing that Nietzsche believed was</text><text start="338.2" dur="6.08">it&amp;#39;s not possible to be free, in some sense, unless you have been a slave.</text><text start="344.6" dur="6.84">By that he meant that you don&amp;#39;t go from childhood to full-fledged adult individuality.</text><text start="351.98" dur="6.2">You go from childhood to a state of discipline, which you might think is akin to slavery,</text><text start="358.68" dur="7.96">to self-imposed slavery, that would be the best scenario, where you have disciplined yourself to become something specific,</text><text start="366.78" dur="5.04">before you might be able to re-attain the generality that you had as a child.</text><text start="372.66" dur="5.52">And he believed that Christianity had played that role for Western civilization.</text><text start="378.66" dur="5.14">But, in the late eighteen hundreds, he announced that God was dead.</text><text start="384.32" dur="5.06">And you often hear of that as something triumphant.</text><text start="390" dur="5.78">But for Nietzsche, it wasn&amp;#39;t because he was too nuanced a thinker to be that simple-minded.</text><text start="395.78" dur="5.36">See, Nietzsche understood that, this is something I&amp;#39;m going to try to make clear, is that</text><text start="404.96" dur="6.82">there&amp;#39;s a very large amount that we don&amp;#39;t know about the structure of experience, that we don&amp;#39;t know about reality.</text><text start="411.94" dur="8">And we have our articulated representations of the world, and then, outside of that, there are things we know absolutely nothing about.</text><text start="419.94" dur="1.98">And there&amp;#39;s a buffer between them.</text><text start="421.92" dur="2.68">And those are things we sort of know something about.</text><text start="424.7" dur="2.32">We don&amp;#39;t know them in an articulated way, here&amp;#39;s an example.</text><text start="427.02" dur="5.62">You know sometimes you&amp;#39;re arguing with someone close to you and they&amp;#39;re in a bad mood, you know?</text><text start="432.84" dur="5.12">And they&amp;#39;re being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up.</text><text start="438.06" dur="3.46">And maybe all of the sudden they get angry, or maybe they cry.</text><text start="441.76" dur="6.86">And then when they cry, they figure out what they&amp;#39;re angry about and it has nothing to do with you, even though you might have been what precipitated the argument.</text><text start="448.98" dur="8.76">And that&amp;#39;s an interesting phenomena as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, because it means that people can know things at one level without being able to speak what they know at another.</text><text start="457.94" dur="7">So in some sense, the thoughts rise up from the body, and they do that in moods, and they do that in images, and they do that in actions.</text><text start="465.34" dur="6.64">And we have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner.</text><text start="472.48" dur="7.92">So we have this articulated space that we can all discuss and then outside of that we have something that is more akin to a dream that we&amp;#39;re embedded in.</text><text start="480.4" dur="2.64">It&amp;#39;s an emotional dream that we&amp;#39;re embedded in.</text><text start="483.04" dur="3.52">That&amp;#39;s based, at least in part, on our actions, I&amp;#39;ll describe that later.</text><text start="486.56" dur="3.04">And then outside of that is what we don&amp;#39;t know anything about at all.</text><text start="490" dur="4.6">And in that dream, that&amp;#39;s where the mystics live, and that&amp;#39;s where the artists live.</text><text start="494.6" dur="4.98">And they&amp;#39;re the mediators between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure.</text><text start="502.1" dur="8.38">You see, what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of knowledge that we don&amp;#39;t really understand.</text><text start="510.48" dur="6.22">And that if those two things are out of sync, so you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream,</text><text start="516.74" dur="3.34">then we become dissociated internally.</text><text start="520.08" dur="4.24">We think things we don&amp;#39;t act out and we act out things we don&amp;#39;t dream.</text><text start="524.32" dur="3.32">And that produces a kind of sickness of the spirit.</text><text start="527.78" dur="10.02">And that sickness of the spirit, its cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation.</text><text start="538.14" dur="6.06">And then people turn to things like ideologies, which I regard as parasites on an underlying religious substructure</text><text start="544.2" dur="3.5">to try to organize their thinking, and then that&amp;#39;s a catastrophe.</text><text start="547.7" dur="2.32">And that&amp;#39;s what Nietzsche foresaw.</text><text start="550.04" dur="9.38">You see, he knew that when we knocked the slats out of the base of Western civilization by destroying this representation, this &amp;quot;god ideal,&amp;quot; let&amp;#39;s say,</text><text start="559.8" dur="6.68">that we would destabilize and move back and forth violently between nihilism and the extremes of ideology.</text><text start="566.48" dur="3.68">He was particularly concerned about radical left ideology.</text><text start="570.64" dur="7.38">He believed and predicted this in the late eighteen hundreds, which is really an absolute intellectual tour-de-force of staggering magnitude.</text><text start="578.2" dur="6.36">He predicted that in the twentieth century that hundreds of millions of people would die because of the replacement of these</text><text start="584.74" dur="7.84">underlying dreamlike structures with this rational but deeply incorrect representation of the world.</text><text start="592.58" dur="5.34">And we&amp;#39;ve been oscillating back and forth between left and right, in some sense, ever since,</text><text start="597.92" dur="3.54">with some good sprinkling of nihilism in there, and despair.</text><text start="601.8" dur="7.24">In some sense, that&amp;#39;s the situation of the modern Western person and increasingly, of people in general.</text><text start="609.56" dur="8.74">You know, I think part of the reason that Islam has its back up, with regards to the West to such a degree, I mean there&amp;#39;s many reasons, and not all of them are valid, that&amp;#39;s for sure,</text><text start="618.5" dur="14.24">but one of the reasons is that they, being still grounded in a dream, let&amp;#39;s say, they can see that the rootless questioning mind of the West poses a tremendous danger to the integrity of their culture.</text><text start="632.74" dur="6.84">And it does, I mean, Westerners, us, we undermine ourselves all the time with our searching intellect.</text><text start="639.6" dur="2.56">And I&amp;#39;m not complaining about that.</text><text start="643.34" dur="2.86">There isn&amp;#39;t anything easy that can be done about it.</text><text start="646.94" dur="5.2">But it&amp;#39;s still a sort of fruitful catastrophe.</text><text start="652.6" dur="3.5">And it has real effects on people&amp;#39;s lives.</text><text start="656.12" dur="2">It&amp;#39;s not some abstract thing.</text><text start="658.8" dur="6.4">Lots of times, when I&amp;#39;ve been treating people with depression, for example, or anxiety, they have existential issues, you know?</text><text start="665.2" dur="2">It&amp;#39;s not just some psychiatric condition.</text><text start="667.2" dur="7.7">It&amp;#39;s not just that they&amp;#39;re tapped off of normal because their brain chemistry is faulty, although sometimes that happens to be the case.</text><text start="674.92" dur="8.46">It&amp;#39;s that they are overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their life and they&amp;#39;re not sure why it&amp;#39;s reasonable to continue with it.</text><text start="683.48" dur="8.02">They can feel the terrible negative meanings of life, but are skeptical beyond belief about any of the positive meanings.</text><text start="691.5" dur="5.14">I had one client who&amp;#39;s a very brilliant artist and as long as he didn&amp;#39;t think he was fine.</text><text start="696.64" dur="3.82">Because he&amp;#39;d go and create, and he was really good at being an artist.</text><text start="700.46" dur="6.58">He had that personality that was continually creative and quite brilliant, although he was self-denigrating.</text><text start="707.1" dur="12.3">But as soon as he started to think about what he was doing, then, it&amp;#39;s like a drill or a saw, he&amp;#39;d saw the branch off that he was sitting on.</text><text start="719.4" dur="6.2">He&amp;#39;d start to criticize what he was doing, even the utility of it, even though it was sort of self-evidently useful.</text><text start="725.6" dur="4.62">And then it would be very, very hard for him to even motivate himself to create.</text><text start="730.66" dur="12.6">He alway struck me as a good example of the consequences of having your rational intellect divorced in some way from your being.</text><text start="743.26" dur="3.54">Divorced enough that it actually questions the utility of your being.</text><text start="747.14" dur="3.6">And it&amp;#39;s not a good thing, it&amp;#39;s not a good thing.</text><text start="751.96" dur="7.6">It&amp;#39;s really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only in individual psychopathology, but also in social psychopathology,</text><text start="759.58" dur="9.9">and that&amp;#39;s this proclivity of people to get tangled up in ideologies, which I really do think of, they&amp;#39;re like crippled religions, that&amp;#39;s the right way to think about them.</text><text start="769.48" dur="3.82">They&amp;#39;re like religion that&amp;#39;s missing an arm and a leg but can still hobble along.</text><text start="773.3" dur="6.46">And it provides a certain amount of security and group identity, but it&amp;#39;s warped and twisted and demented and bent.</text><text start="779.78" dur="3.84">And it&amp;#39;s a parasite on something underlying that&amp;#39;s rich and true.</text><text start="784.06" dur="2.32">That&amp;#39;s how it looks to me, anyways.</text><text start="786.56" dur="5.1">So I think it&amp;#39;s very important that we sort out this problem.</text><text start="792.14" dur="5.08">I think that there isn&amp;#39;t anything more important that needs to be done that.</text><text start="797.22" dur="3.28">I&amp;#39;ve thought that for a long, long time.</text><text start="800.9" dur="2.4">Probably since the early eighties,</text><text start="804.52" dur="7">when I started looking at the role that belief systems played in regulating psychological and social health.</text><text start="812.24" dur="6.64">You can tell that they do that because of how upset people get if you challenge their belief systems.</text><text start="818.88" dur="2.08">It&amp;#39;s like, why the hell do they care, exactly?</text><text start="820.96" dur="6.62">What difference does it make if all of your ideological axioms are 100% correct?</text><text start="827.58" dur="4.84">People get unbelievably upset when you poke them in the axioms, so to speak.</text><text start="832.42" dur="0.5">[LAUGHTER]</text><text start="833" dur="4.94">And it isn&amp;#39;t odd by any stretch of the imagination obvious why.</text><text start="838.06" dur="5.52">But there&amp;#39;s some, it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a fundamental truth that they&amp;#39;re standing on.</text><text start="843.58" dur="4.06">It&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you&amp;#39;re starting to pull out the logs.</text><text start="847.64" dur="2.4">They&amp;#39;re afraid they&amp;#39;re going to fall in and drown.</text><text start="850.12" dur="1.84">It&amp;#39;s like, drawing in what?</text><text start="851.96" dur="3.5">What are the logs protecting them from?</text><text start="855.6" dur="5.38">Why are they so afraid to move beyond the confines of the ideological system?</text><text start="861.22" dur="2">These are not obvious things.</text><text start="863.68" dur="4.08">So, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to puzzle that out for a very long time.</text><text start="867.76" dur="3.64">I&amp;#39;ve done some lectures about that are on Youtube; most of you know that.</text><text start="871.4" dur="5.56">Some of what I&amp;#39;m going to talk about in this series you&amp;#39;ll have heard, if you&amp;#39;ve listened to the Youtube videos.</text><text start="876.96" dur="3.4">You know, I&amp;#39;m trying to hit it from different angles.</text><text start="880.8" dur="7.04">So Nietzsche&amp;#39;s idea was that human beings were going to have to create their own values, essentially.</text><text start="887.84" dur="3.92">Now he understood that we understood that we have bodies and we have motivations and emotions.</text><text start="891.8" dur="11.08">Like, he was a romantic thinker, in some sense, but way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn&amp;#39;t some free-floating soul but was embedded in our physiology,</text><text start="902.88" dur="3.98">constrained by our emotions, shaped by our motivations, shaped by our body.</text><text start="906.9" dur="0.9">He understood that.</text><text start="908" dur="10.34">But he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would be for human beings themselves to become something akin to God and to create their own values.</text><text start="918.58" dur="6.8">And he thought about the person who creates their own values as the over-man or the super-man.</text><text start="925.72" dur="9.78">And that was one of the parts of Nietzschian philosophy that the Nazis, I would say, took out of context and used to fuel their superior man ideology.</text><text start="938.04" dur="1.66">And we know what happened with that.</text><text start="939.7" dur="2.08">That didn&amp;#39;t seem to turn out very well, that&amp;#39;s for sure.</text><text start="944" dur="2.88">I also spent a lot of time reading Carl Jung.</text><text start="946.94" dur="8.24">It was through Jung and also Jean Piaget, who was a developmental psychologist, that I started to understand that our articulated systems of thought</text><text start="955.86" dur="6.66">are embedded in something like a dream and that that dream was informed, in a complex way, by the way we act.</text><text start="965.54" dur="2.62">We act out things we don&amp;#39;t understand all the time.</text><text start="968.16" dur="4.82">If that wasn&amp;#39;t the case, then we wouldn&amp;#39;t need a psychology or a sociology or an anthropology or any of that</text><text start="973" dur="2.36">because we would be completely transparent to ourselves.</text><text start="975.5" dur="1.22">And we&amp;#39;re clearly not.</text><text start="977.02" dur="8.14">So, we&amp;#39;re much more complicated than we understand, which means that the way that we behave contains way more information than we know.</text><text start="985.58" dur="8.26">And part of the dream that surrounds our articulated knowledge is being extracted as a consequence of us watching each other behave</text><text start="993.84" dur="3.84">and telling stories about it for thousands and thousands and thousands of years.</text><text start="997.8" dur="4.72">Extracting out patterns of behavior that characterize humanity.</text><text start="1002.74" dur="7.32">And trying to represent them, partly through imitation, but also drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that.</text><text start="1010.06" dur="3.02">To represent what we&amp;#39;re like so we can understand what we&amp;#39;re like.</text><text start="1013.6" dur="6.06">That process of understanding is what I see unfolding, at least in part, in the Biblical stories.</text><text start="1019.74" dur="7.56">And it&amp;#39;s halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and all of that, which is one of the things that makes the book so complex.</text><text start="1027.38" dur="10.32">But I see in it a struggle of humanity to rise above its animal forebears, say, and to become conscious of what it means to be human.</text><text start="1038" dur="5.76">And that&amp;#39;s a very difficult thing because we don&amp;#39;t know who we are or what we are or where we came from or any of those things.</text><text start="1044.1" dur="4.46">The light life is an unbroken chain going back three and a half billion years.</text><text start="1048.56" dur="1.64">It&amp;#39;s an absolutely unbelievable thing.</text><text start="1050.26" dur="5.52">Every single one of your ancestors reproduced successfully for three and a half billion years.</text><text start="1056" dur="1.92">It&amp;#39;s absolutely unbelievable.</text><text start="1058.14" dur="5.46">We rose out of the dirt and the muck and here we are, conscious, but not knowing.</text><text start="1064.1" dur="1.66">And we&amp;#39;re trying to

How did that happen?</text><text start="1093.8" dur="8.06">It&amp;#39;s by no means obvious, and one of the things that bothers me about casual critics of religion is that they don&amp;#39;t take the phenomena seriously.</text><text start="1101.86" dur="1.46">And it&amp;#39;s a serious phenomena.</text><text start="1104.7" dur="4.54">Not least because people have the capacity for religious experience, and no one know why that is.</text><text start="1109.24" dur="3.18">I mean, you can induce it reliably, in all sorts of different ways.</text><text start="1112.42" dur="2.1">You can do it with brain stimulation.</text><text start="1114.52" dur="1.64">You can certainly do it with drugs.</text><text start="1116.16" dur="6.96">There&amp;#39;s, especially the psychedelic variety, they produce intimations of the divine extraordinarily regularly.</text><text start="1123.12" dur="6.04">People have been using drugs like that for God only knows how long, fifty thousand years, maybe more than that,</text><text start="1129.4" dur="3.68">to produce some sort of intimate union with the divine.</text><text start="1133.08" dur="4.34">We don&amp;#39;t understand any of that when we discovered the psychedelics in the late sixties.</text><text start="1137.42" dur="6.44">It shocked everybody so badly that they were instantly made illegal and abandoned, in terms of research, for like fifty years.</text><text start="1143.86" dur="3.52">And it&amp;#39;s no wonder, because who the hell expected that?</text><text start="1147.84" dur="0.56">Nobody.</text><text start="1150.32" dur="0.5">Now,</text><text start="1152.64" dur="7">now Jung was a student of Nietzsche&amp;#39;s, you see, and he was also, I would say, a very astute critic of Nietzsche.</text><text start="1159.8" dur="2.9">He was educated by Freud, and Freud</text><text start="1164.06" dur="8.3">Freud, I suppose, in some sense, started to collate the information that we had pertaining to the notion that people lived inside a dream.</text><text start="1172.36" dur="4.36">You know, it was Freud who really popularized the idea of the unconscious mind.</text><text start="1176.72" dur="6.14">We take this for granted to such a degree today that we don&amp;#39;t understand how revolutionary the idea was.</text><text start="1182.86" dur="7.16">But what&amp;#39;s happened with Freud is that we&amp;#39;ve taken all the marrow out of his bones, so to speak, and left the husk behind.</text><text start="1190.02" dur="5.6">And now when we think about Freud, we just think about the husk because that&amp;#39;s everything that&amp;#39;s been discarded.</text><text start="1195.62" dur="9.98">But so much of what he discovered is part of our popular conception now, including the idea that your perceptions and your actions and your thoughts are all, what would you say,</text><text start="1205.6" dur="6.12">informed and shaped by unconscious motivations that are not part of your voluntary control.</text><text start="1211.72" dur="1.78">And that&amp;#39;s a very, very strange thing.</text><text start="1213.5" dur="4.66">It&amp;#39;s one of the most unsettling things about the psychoanalytic theories</text><text start="1218.16" dur="9.14">is the psychoanalytic theories are something like, you&amp;#39;re a loose collection of living sub-personalities, each with its own set of motivations and perceptions</text><text start="1227.3" dur="2.56">and emotions and rationales, all of that.</text><text start="1230.26" dur="8.58">And you have limited control over that, so you&amp;#39;re like a plurality of internal personalities that&amp;#39;s loosely linked into a unity.</text><text start="1239.12" dur="8.4">And you know that because you can&amp;#39;t control yourself very well, which is one of Jung&amp;#39;s objections to Nietzsche&amp;#39;s idea that we can create our own values is that</text><text start="1247.52" dur="3.88">is that Jung didn&amp;#39;t believe that, especially not after interacting with Freud.</text><text start="1251.4" dur="7.2">Because he saw that human beings were affected by things that were- deeply, deeply affected by things that were beyond their conscious control.</text><text start="1258.92" dur="2.68">An no one really knows how to conceptualize those things.</text><text start="1261.84" dur="4.54">The cognitive psychologists think about them in some sense as computational machines.</text><text start="1266.8" dur="3.94">The ancient people, I think, thought of them as gods, although it&amp;#39;s more complex than that.</text><text start="1270.74" dur="6.14">Like rage would be a god. Mars, the god of rage, that&amp;#39;s the thing that possesses you when you&amp;#39;re angry.</text><text start="1276.88" dur="4.24">It has a viewpoint, it says what it wants to say.</text><text start="1281.12" dur="3.52">And that might have very little to do with what you want to say when you&amp;#39;re being sensible.</text><text start="1284.98" dur="2.58">And it doesn&amp;#39;t just inhabit you, it inhabits everyone.</text><text start="1287.56" dur="3.38">And it lives forever, and it even inhabits animals.</text><text start="1291.06" dur="9.68">So it&amp;#39;s this transcendent psychological entity that inhabits the body politic, like a thought inhabits the brain.</text><text start="1300.74" dur="1.54">That&amp;#39;s one way of thinking about it.</text><text start="1302.54" dur="4.24">A very strange way of thinking, but it certainly has its merits.</text><text start="1307.26" dur="4.56">And so in some sense, those are deities, although it&amp;#39;s not that simple.</text><text start="1312.44" dur="7.38">And so Jung got very interested in dreams and started to understand the relationship between dreams and myths.</text><text start="1319.88" dur="6.86">Because he would see in his clients&amp;#39; dreams echoes of stories that he knew because he was deeply read in mythology.</text><text start="1326.76" dur="11.02">And then he started to believe that the dream was the birthplace of the myth and that there was a continual interaction between the two processes, the dream and the story, and storytelling.</text><text start="1337.78" dur="3.8">Well, you know, you tend to tell your dreams as stories when you remember them.</text><text start="1341.74" dur="3.26">Some people remember dreams all the time, like two or three a night.</text><text start="1345" dur="1.54">I&amp;#39;ve had clients like that.</text><text start="1346.54" dur="3.74">They often have archetypal dreams that have very clear mythological structures.</text><text start="1350.28" dur="6">I think that&amp;#39;s more the case with people who are creative, by the way, especially if they&amp;#39;re a bit unstable, at the time.</text><text start="1356.34" dur="9.82">Because the dream tends to occupy the space of uncertainty and to concentrate on fleshing out the unknown reality before you get a real grip on it.</text><text start="1366.16" dur="4.46">So it&amp;#39;s like the dream is the birthplace of thinking, that&amp;#39;s a good way of thinking about it.</text><text start="1370.62" dur="3.4">So because it&amp;#39;s the birthplace of thinking, it&amp;#39;s not that clear.</text><text start="1374.02" dur="4.32">It&amp;#39;s doing its best to formulate something. That was Jung&amp;#39;s notion,</text><text start="1379.04" dur="5.44">as opposed to Freud, who believed that there were sensors, internal sensors that were hiding the dream&amp;#39;s true message.</text><text start="1384.52" dur="10.92">That&amp;#39;s not what Jung believed, he believed the dream was doing its best to express a reality that was still outside of fully articulated conscious comprehension.</text><text start="1395.44" dur="6.64">Because you think, look, a thought appears in your head, right? That&amp;#39;s obvious. Bang, it&amp;#39;s nothing you ever ask about.</text><text start="1402.08" dur="1.56">But what the hell does that mean?</text><text start="1404.1" dur="1.82">A thought appears in your head.</text><text start="1405.92" dur="2.74">What kind of ridiculous explanation is that?</text><text start="1410.66" dur="1.74">It just doesn&amp;#39;t help with anything.</text><text start="1412.4" dur="1.5">Where does it come from?</text><text start="1414.02" dur="2.8">Well, nowhere. It just appears in my head.</text><text start="1416.82" dur="4.32">Okay, well, that&amp;#39;s not a very sophisticated explanation, as it turns out.</text><text start="1421.4" dur="4.36">So you might think that those thoughts that you think, well, where do they come from?</text><text start="1425.76" dur="2.04">Well, they&amp;#39;re often someone else&amp;#39;s thoughts, right?</text><text start="1427.82" dur="7.62">Someone long dead, that might be part of it, just like the words you use to think are utterances of people who&amp;#39;ve been long dead.</text><text start="1435.44" dur="4.98">And so you&amp;#39;re informed by the spirit of your ancestors, that&amp;#39;s one way of looking at it.</text><text start="1440.42" dur="4.66">And your motivations speak to you, your emotions speak to you, your body speaks to you.</text><text start="1445.08" dur="3.7">And it does all that, at least in part, through the dream.</text><text start="1449.32" dur="4.16">And the dream is the birthplace of the fully articulated idea.</text><text start="1454.16" dur="2.66">They don&amp;#39;t just come from nowhere fully fledged, right?</text><text start="1456.9" dur="8.62">They have a developmental origin, and God only knows how lengthy that origin is, even to say something like, &amp;quot;I am conscious.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1467.44" dur="2.14">Chimpanzees don&amp;#39;t say that.</text><text start="1470.26" dur="5.86">It&amp;#39;s been seven million years since we broke from chimpanzees, something like that, from the common ancestor.</text><text start="1476.18" dur="7.14">They have no articulated knowledge at all and very little self-representation in some sense, and very little self-consciousness.</text><text start="1483.66" dur="1.66">And that&amp;#39;s not the case with us at all.</text><text start="1485.64" dur="5.8">We had to painstakingly figure all of this out during that, you know, seven million year voyage.</text><text start="1491.92" dur="7.42">And I think some of that&amp;#39;s represented and captured, in some sense, in these ancient stories.</text><text start="1499.4" dur="9">Which I believe were part of, especially the oldest stories, in Genesis, which are the stories we&amp;#39;re going to start with, they were... that...</text><text start="1508.82" dur="7.84">some of the archaic nature of the human being is encapsulated in those stories, and it&amp;#39;s very, very instructive as far as I can tell.</text><text start="1516.66" dur="1.62">I&amp;#39;ll give you just a quick example.</text><text start="1518.28" dur="4.54">You know there&amp;#39;s an idea of sacrifice in the Old Testament.</text><text start="1523.16" dur="7.3">And it&amp;#39;s pretty barbaric, you know, I mean the story of Abraham and Isaac, there&amp;#39;s a good example of that because Abraham is called on to actually sacrifice his own son,</text><text start="1530.46" dur="3.96">which doesn&amp;#39;t really seem like something that a reasonable God would ask you to do, right?</text><text start="1534.8" dur="6.08">God in the Old Testament is frequently cruel and arbitrary and demanding and paradoxical,</text><text start="1540.96" dur="10.88">which is one of the things that really gives the book life because it wasn&amp;#39;t edited by a committee, you know, a committee that was concerned with not offending anyone, that&amp;#39;s for sure.</text><text start="1551.84" dur="1.04">[LAUGHTER]</text><text start="1554" dur="8.08">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="1564.58" dur="10">So Jung believed that the dream was the birthplace of thought and I&amp;#39;ve been extending that idea because one of the things I wondered about deeply was,</text><text start="1574.58" dur="3.2">you know, you have a dream and then someone interprets it.</text><text start="1578.1" dur="7.84">You can argue about whether or not an interpretation is valid, just like you can argue about whether your interpretation of a novel or movie is valid, right?</text><text start="1586.36" dur="3.74">It&amp;#39;s a very difficult thing to determine with any degree of accuracy,</text><text start="1590.34" dur="2.08">which accounts in part for the post-modern critique.</text><text start="1592.86" dur="10.56">But my observations being that people will present a dream and sometimes we can extract out real useful information from it that the person didn&amp;#39;t appear.</text><text start="1604.06" dur="2.08">And they get a flash of insight.</text><text start="1606.14" dur="6.48">To me that&amp;#39;s a marker that we&amp;#39;ve stumbled on something that unites part of that person that wasn&amp;#39;t united before.</text><text start="1612.68" dur="8.54">It pulls things together, which is often what a good story will do, whereas sometimes a good theory, you know if things snap together for you, there&amp;#39;s a little light goes on,</text><text start="1621.22" dur="4.72">and that&amp;#39;s one of the markers that I&amp;#39;ve used for accuracy in dreams.</text><text start="1626.68" dur="7.22">In my own family, when I was first married, you know, I&amp;#39;d have fights with my wife, arguments about this and that.</text><text start="1635.64" dur="11.24">I&amp;#39;m fairly hot-headed and so I&amp;#39;d get all puffed up and agitated about whatever we were arguing about, and she&amp;#39;d go to sleep, which was really annoying, it is so annoying!</text><text start="1646.98" dur="1.28">[LAUGHTER]</text><text start="1648.62" dur="7">Because I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep, right? I was like, chewing off my fingernails, and she&amp;#39;d, like, sleeping peacefully beside me and it&amp;#39;s so maddening.</text><text start="1655.98" dur="7.28">But often she&amp;#39;d have a dream, you know, and then the next morning, she&amp;#39;d discuss it with me, and then we could unravel what was at the bottom of our argument.</text><text start="1663.58" dur="3.58">That was unbelievably useful, even though it was extraordinarily aggravating.</text><text start="1669.14" dur="1.44">So you know, I was convinced by Jung.</text><text start="1670.68" dur="9.74">It looked to me like his ideas about the relationship between dreams and mythology and drama and literature made sense to me and the relationship between that and art.</text><text start="1680.64" dur="3.5">I know this native carver, he&amp;#39;s a Kwakwaka&amp;#39;wakw guy.</text><text start="1684.42" dur="5.76">He&amp;#39;s carved a bunch of wooden sculptures, totem poles and masks that I have at my house.</text><text start="1690.18" dur="1.86">He&amp;#39;s a very interesting person.</text><text start="1692.04" dur="6.04">Not literate, not particularly literate, and really still steeped in this ancient, 13,000 year old tradition.</text><text start="1698.08" dur="8.34">He&amp;#39;s an original language speaker and the fact that he isn&amp;#39;t literate has sort of left him with the mind of someone who&amp;#39;s pre-literate.</text><text start="1706.42" dur="5.68">Pre-literate people aren&amp;#39;t stupid, they&amp;#39;re just not literate, so their brains are organized differently in many ways.</text><text start="1712.1" dur="10.18">And I&amp;#39;ve asked him about his intuition for his carvings, and he&amp;#39;s told me that he dreams, like, you&amp;#39;ve seen the Haida masks, you know what they look like,</text><text start="1722.34" dur="5.18">well, his people are mostly related to the Haida, so it&amp;#39;s the same kind of style.</text><text start="1727.96" dur="5.36">And he said he dreams in those kind of animals, and can remember his dreams.</text><text start="1733.38" dur="8.46">And he also talks to his grandparents, who taught him how to carve, in his dreams quite often. If he runs into a problem with carving, his grandparents will come and he&amp;#39;ll talk to them.</text><text start="1742.28" dur="7.14">But he sees the creatures that he&amp;#39;s going to carve living, in an animated sense, in his imagination.</text><text start="1749.42" dur="5.66">I mean, it&amp;#39;s not difficult. First of all, I have no reason to disbelieve him. He&amp;#39;s a very, very straightforward person.</text><text start="1755.08" dur="5.78">And he doesn&amp;#39;t the motivation or the guile, I would say, in some sense, to invent a story like that.</text><text start="1760.86" dur="2.2">There&amp;#39;s just no reason he would possibly do it.</text><text start="1763.06" dur="3.76">I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s told that many people about it. He thinks it&amp;#39;s kind of crazy, you know?</text><text start="1766.82" dur="4.88">He said when he was a kid, he thought he was insane because he&amp;#39;d have those dreams all the time.</text><text start="1772.08" dur="2.28">About these creatures and so forth.</text><text start="1774.36" dur="2.08">And so it wasn&amp;#39;t something he was trumpeting.</text><text start="1776.96" dur="6.96">But I found it fascinating because I can see in him part of the manifestation of this unbroken tradition.</text><text start="1783.92" dur="4.68">We have no idea how traditions like that are really passed along for thousands and thousands of years, right?</text><text start="1788.96" dur="6.66">Part of it&amp;#39;s oral and memory, part of it&amp;#39;s acted out and dramatized and then part of it&amp;#39;s going to be imaginative.</text><text start="1795.62" dur="3.56">And people who aren&amp;#39;t literate, they store information quite differently than we do.</text><text start="1799.18" dur="2.88">We don&amp;#39;t remember anything. It&amp;#39;s all written down in books, right?</text><text start="1802.06" dur="5.48">But if you&amp;#39;re from an oral culture, especially if you&amp;#39;re trained in that way, you have all of that information at hand.</text><text start="1807.54" dur="4.36">So you can speak and you can tell the stories, and you really know them.</text><text start="1811.9" dur="2.6">You know, modern people don&amp;#39;t really know what that&amp;#39;s like any more.</text><text start="1814.5" dur="6.14">I doubt if there&amp;#39;s maybe more than two of you in the audience that could spout from memory, like, a thirty line poem.</text><text start="1820.64" dur="2.92">You know, and poetry was written so that people could do that.</text><text start="1823.56" dur="5.48">That&amp;#39;s why we have that form, is so that people could remember it and have it with them.</text><text start="1829.06" dur="1.62">But we don&amp;#39;t do any of that any more.</text><text start="1831.6" dur="1.52">Anyways, back to Jung.</text><text start="1835.3" dur="5.18">Jung was a great believer in the dream, and I know that dreams will tell you things that you don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="1840.48" dur="7.3">And then I thought, well how the hell can that be? How in the world can something you think up tell you something you don&amp;#39;t know?</text><text start="1847.84" dur="1.92">How does that make any sense?</text><text start="1849.94" dur="5.2">First of all, why don&amp;#39;t you understand it? Why does it have to come forth in the form of the dream?</text><text start="1855.14" dur="4.74">It&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re not- there&amp;#39;s something going on inside you that you don&amp;#39;t control, right?</text><text start="1859.88" dur="2.9">The dream happens to you just like life happens to you.</text><text start="1862.78" dur="6.52">I mean there is the odd lucid dreamer who can, you know, apply a certain amount of conscious control, but most of the time it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1869.56" dur="6.92">you&amp;#39;re laying there asleep and this crazy, complicated world manifests itself inside you.</text><text start="1876.7" dur="3.06">And you don&amp;#39;t know how. You can&amp;#39;t do it when you&amp;#39;re awake.</text><text start="1880.08" dur="3.18">And you don&amp;#39;t know what it means! It&amp;#39;s like what the hell&amp;#39;s going on?</text><text start="1883.26" dur="3.66">And that&amp;#39;s one of the things that&amp;#39;s so damn frightening about the psychoanalysts, because</text><text start="1887.3" dur="9.8">you get this with Freud and Jung, you really start to understand that there are things inside you that are happening that control you instead of the other way around.</text><text start="1897.1" dur="9.76">You, you know, use a bit of reciprocal control, but there&amp;#39;s manifestations of spirits, so to speak, inside you that determine the manner in which you walk through life.</text><text start="1907.36" dur="2.64">And you don&amp;#39;t control it. And what does?</text><text start="1910.88" dur="8.98">Is it random? You know, there are people who have claimed that dreams are merely the consequence of random neuronal firing, which is a theory I think is absolutely absurd.</text><text start="1919.86" dur="2.52">Because there&amp;#39;s nothing random about dreams.</text><text start="1922.74" dur="3.88">They&amp;#39;re very, very structured and very, very complex.</text><text start="1926.62" dur="6.42">And not like snow on a television screen or static on the radio. Like, those things are complicated.</text><text start="1933.52" dur="5.46">And also, I&amp;#39;ve seen so often that people have very coherent dreams that have a perfect narrative structure.</text><text start="1939.34" dur="7.4">You know, they&amp;#39;re fully developed, in some sense. And so that theory just doesn&amp;#39;t go anywhere with me.

you&amp;#39;ve ever attained anything, because as soon as you attain it, then the whole little game ends,</text><text start="4485.9" dur="1.78">and you have to come up with another game.</text><text start="4488.1" dur="1.68">Right, so it&amp;#39;s Sisyphus.</text><text start="4490.14" dur="1.12">And that&amp;#39;s okay.</text><text start="4491.26" dur="5.12">But it does show that the attainment

dur="0.8">[LAUGHTER]</text><text start="4509.18" dur="8.9">So what happens is that human beings are weird creatures because we&amp;#39;re much more activated by having an aim and moving towards it than we are by attainment.</text><text start="4518.08" dur="4.1">And what that means is you have to have an aim and that means you have to have an interpretation.</text><text start="4522.18" dur="5.78">And it also means that the nobler the aim, that&amp;#39;s one way of thinking about it, the better your life.</text><text start="4528.46" dur="7.4">And that&amp;#39;s a really interesting thing to know because you&amp;#39;ve heard ever since you were tiny that you should act like a good person and you shouldn&amp;#39;t lie, for example.</text><text start="4535.86" dur="5.06">And you might think, well, why the hell should I act like a good person and why not lie?</text><text start="4540.92" dur="5.44">I mean, even a three year old can ask that question because smart kids learn to lie earlier, by the way.</text><text start="4546.68" dur="7.46">And they think well, why not twist the fabric of reality so that it serves your specific short-term needs?</text><text start="4554.14" dur="2.2">I mean, that&amp;#39;s a great question, why not do that?</text><text start="4556.34" dur="5.42">Why act morally if you can get away with something and it brings you closer to something you want?</text><text start="4561.76" dur="1.46">Well, why not do it?</text><text start="4563.5" dur="2.86">These are good questions, it&amp;#39;s not self-evident.</text><text start="4566.44" dur="3.6">Well, it seems to me tied in with what I just mentioned.</text><text start="4570.04" dur="4.1">It&amp;#39;s like, you de-stabilize yourself and things become chaotic, and that&amp;#39;s not good.</text><text start="4574.24" dur="7.26">And if you don&amp;#39;t have a noble aim, then you have nothing but shallow, trivial pleasures.</text><text start="4581.66" dur="2.1">And they don&amp;#39;t sustain you.</text><text start="4583.76" dur="6.08">And that&amp;#39;s not because because life is so difficult, it&amp;#39;s so much suffering, it&amp;#39;s so complex.</text><text start="4589.9" dur="2.84">It ends, and everyone dies, and it&amp;#39;s painful.</text><text start="4593.06" dur="3.32">It&amp;#39;s like without a noble aim, how can you withstand any of that?</text><text start="4596.7" dur="0.72">You can&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="4597.42" dur="6.16">You become desperate, and once you become desparate, things go from bad to worse very rapidly.</text><text start="4604.18" dur="2.64">And so there&amp;#39;s the idea of the noble aim.</text><text start="4607.06" dur="3.24">And it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s necessary.</text><text start="4610.3" dur="2.18">It&amp;#39;s the bread that people cannot live without, right?</text><text start="4612.48" dur="3">That&amp;#39;s not physical bread, it&amp;#39;s the noble aim.</text><text start="4615.54" dur="1.12">And what is that?</text><text start="4617.08" dur="0.5">Well,</text><text start="4618.2" dur="2.52">It was encapsulated in part in the story of Marduk.</text><text start="4620.9" dur="7.56">It&amp;#39;s to pay attention, it&amp;#39;s to speak properly, it&amp;#39;s to confront chaos, it&amp;#39;s to make a better world, it&amp;#39;s something like that.</text><text start="4629" dur="12.42">And that&amp;#39;s enough of a noble aim so that you can stand up without cringing at the very thought of your own existence so that you can do something that&amp;#39;s worthwhile to justify your wretched position on the planet.</text><text start="4642.06" dur="3.06">Now the literary issue is that...</text><text start="4646.52" dur="0.5">look,</text><text start="4648.28" dur="3.54">you take a text, you can interpret it in a variety of ways, but that&amp;#39;s not right.</text><text start="4651.82" dur="2.38">This is where the Post-Modernists went wrong because</text><text start="4655.38" dur="6.08">what you&amp;#39;re looking for, in a text, and in the world, for that matter, is sufficient order and direction.</text><text start="4661.9" dur="3.7">So then we have to think, well what does sufficient order and direction mean?</text><text start="4665.6" dur="4.04">Well you don&amp;#39;t want to suffer so much that your life is unbearable, right?</text><text start="4669.8" dur="1.42">That just seems self-evident.</text><text start="4671.4" dur="2.78">Pain argues for itself.</text><text start="4674.76" dur="4.24">I think of pain as the fundamental reality because no one disputes it, right?</text><text start="4679.42" dur="4.9">Even if you say that you don&amp;#39;t believe in pain, it doesn&amp;#39;t help when you&amp;#39;re in pain.</text><text start="4684.58" dur="1.24">You still believe in it.</text><text start="4687.1" dur="3.8">You can&amp;#39;t pry it up with logic and rationality.</text><text start="4690.9" dur="3.28">It just stands forth as a fundament of existence.</text><text start="4694.18" dur="2.16">And that&amp;#39;s actually quite useful to know.</text><text start="4696.56" dur="3.44">You say, well, you don&amp;#39;t want any more of that than is absolutely necessary.</text><text start="4700.12" dur="1.88">And I think that&amp;#39;s self-evident.</text><text start="4702" dur="2.34">Then you say, wait a minute, it&amp;#39;s more complicated than that.</text><text start="4704.8" dur="7">You don&amp;#39;t want any more of that than is necessary today, but also not tomorrow and not next week and not next month and not next year.</text><text start="4711.9" dur="4.92">So however you act now better not compromise how you&amp;#39;re going to be in a year.</text><text start="4717.14" dur="1.6">Because that&amp;#39;d just be counter-productive.</text><text start="4718.74" dur="2.88">That&amp;#39;s part of of the problem with short-term pleasures, right?</text><text start="4722.52" dur="1.96">Act in haste, repent at leisure.</text><text start="4724.48" dur="1.94">Everyone knows exactly what that means.</text><text start="4726.42" dur="5.1">So you have to act in a way that works now and tomorrow and next week and next month and so forth.</text><text start="4731.52" dur="2.58">And so you have to take your future self into account.</text><text start="4734.52" dur="1.58">And human beings can do that.</text><text start="4736.1" dur="4.94">And taking your future self into account isn&amp;#39;t much different than taking other people into account.</text><text start="4742.36" dur="2.8">I remember there&amp;#39;s this Simpsons episode.</text><text start="4745.62" dur="4.3">And Homer downs a quart of mayonnaise and vodka.</text><text start="4749.98" dur="2.16">[LAUGHTER]</text><text start="4752.4" dur="0.72">And he says</text><text start="4755.44" dur="2.42">Marge says, you know, you shouldn&amp;#39;t really do that.</text><text start="4757.86" dur="2.86">And Homer says, that&amp;#39;s a problem for future Homer.</text><text start="4760.8" dur="3.18">I&amp;#39;m sure glad I&amp;#39;m not that guy.</text><text start="4764.08" dur="0.8">[LAUGHTER]</text><text start="4768.16" dur="2.02">It&amp;#39;s so ridiculous, it caught me, you know?</text><text start="4770.5" dur="7">But you see, we have to grapple with that, and so the you that&amp;#39;s out there in the future is sort of like another person.</text><text start="4777.74" dur="9.06">And so figuring out how to conduct yourself properly in relationship to your future self isn&amp;#39;t much different than figuring out how to conduct yourself in relationship to other people.</text><text start="4787" dur="2.1">But then we could expand the constraints.</text><text start="4789.64" dur="8.1">Not only does the interpretation that you extract have to protect you from suffering and give you an aim, but it has to do it in a way that&amp;#39;s inerrable,</text><text start="4798.54" dur="6.96">so it works across time, and then it has to work in the presence of other people so that you can cooperate with them and compete with them</text><text start="4805.5" dur="2.16">in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t make you suffer more.</text><text start="4807.78" dur="3.12">And people are not that tolerant.</text><text start="4811.68" dur="2.94">They have choices, they don&amp;#39;t have to hang around with you.</text><text start="4814.62" dur="2.22">They can hang around with any one of these other primates.</text><text start="4816.84" dur="6.1">And so, if you don&amp;#39;t act properly, at least within certain boundaries, it&amp;#39;s like, you&amp;#39;re just cast aside.</text><text start="4823.34" dur="6.96">And so people are broadcasting information at you all the time about how you need to interpret the world so they can tolerate being around you.</text><text start="4830.66" dur="3.96">And you need that because socially isolate, you&amp;#39;re insane, and then you&amp;#39;re dead.</text><text start="4834.62" dur="3.54">No one can tolerate being alone for any length of time.</text><text start="4838.16" dur="5.96">We can&amp;#39;t maintain our own sanity without continual feedback from other people because it&amp;#39;s too damn complicated.</text><text start="4844.42" dur="5.3">So you&amp;#39;re constrained by your own existence and then you&amp;#39;re constrained by the existence of other people.</text><text start="4849.72" dur="2.14">And then you&amp;#39;re also constrained by the world.</text><text start="4852.1" dur="10.7">If I read Hamlet and what I extract out of that is the idea that I should jump off a bridge, it&amp;#39;s like it puts my interpretation to an end rather quickly.</text><text start="4862.8" dur="3.68">It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be optimally functional, let&amp;#39;s say.</text><text start="4866.94" dur="4.56">And so an interpretation is constrained by the reality of the world.</text><text start="4871.5" dur="2.1">It&amp;#39;s constrained by the reality of other people.</text><text start="4873.6" dur="2.96">And it&amp;#39;s constrained by your reality across time.</text><text start="4876.6" dur="6.06">There&amp;#39;s only a small number of interpretations that are going to work in that tightly defined space.</text><text start="4882.98" dur="3.46">And so that&amp;#39;s part of the reason that the Post-Modernists are wrong.</text><text start="4886.88" dur="5.9">It&amp;#39;s also part of the reason, by the way, that AI people who&amp;#39;ve been trying to make intelligent machines have had to put them in a body.</text><text start="4893.4" dur="4.42">Because it turns out you just can&amp;#39;t make something intelligent, in some sense, without it being embodied.</text><text start="4897.82" dur="2.5">And it&amp;#39;s partly for the reasons I just described.</text><text start="4900.34" dur="3.66">You need constraints on the system before</text><text start="4904.8" dur="5.46">you need constraints on the system so that the system doesn&amp;#39;t drown in an infinite sea of interpretation.</text><text start="4910.36" dur="1.44">Something like that.</text><text start="4912.04" dur="2.16">So that&amp;#39;s the literary end of it.</text><text start="4914.26" dur="0.64">Moral...</text><text start="4916.3" dur="2.16">Well, morality for me is about action.</text><text start="4918.46" dur="2.32">I&amp;#39;m an existentialist, in some sense.</text><text start="4920.78" dur="6.26">And what that means is that I believe that what people believe to be true is what they act out, not what they say.</text><text start="4927.82" dur="1.88">And so there&amp;#39;s lots of definitions of truth.</text><text start="4929.7" dur="2.06">I mean, truth is a very expansive word.</text><text start="4931.8" dur="5.48">And you can think of objective truth but behavioral truth isn&amp;#39;t the same as objective truth.</text><text start="4937.52" dur="2.88">What you should do isn&amp;#39;t the same as what is,</text><text start="4940.58" dur="1.96">as far as I can tell, but people debate that.</text><text start="4942.54" dur="3.82">But I think the reason that that has to be the case is because...</text><text start="4946.66" dur="1.2">Think about it this way.</text><text start="4947.98" dur="1.7">You&amp;#39;re standing in front of a field.</text><text start="4950.54" dur="1.44">And you can see the field.</text><text start="4952.44" dur="2.28">But the field doesn&amp;#39;t tell you how to walk through it.</text><text start="4955.22" dur="2.76">There&amp;#39;s an infinite number of ways you could walk through it.</text><text start="4958.54" dur="7">And so you can&amp;#39;t extract out an inviolable guide to how you should act from the array of facts that are in front of you.</text><text start="4965.54" dur="1.8">Because there&amp;#39;s just too many facts.</text><text start="4967.86" dur="1.68">And they don&amp;#39;t have directionality.</text><text start="4969.78" dur="1.54">But you, you need to know.</text><text start="4971.32" dur="1.82">You need to know how how not to suffer.</text><text start="4973.16" dur="2.36">And  you need to know what your aim is.</text><text start="4975.74" dur="4.58">And so you have to overlay that objective reality with some interpretive structure.</text><text start="4980.48" dur="3.98">And it&amp;#39;s the nature of that interpretive structure that we&amp;#39;re going to be aiming at hard.</text><text start="4984.46" dur="1.64">I&amp;#39;ve given you some hints about it already.</text><text start="4986.1" dur="4.88">We&amp;#39;ve extracted it in part from observations from our own behavior and other peoples&amp;#39; behavior.</text><text start="4990.98" dur="6.46">And we&amp;#39;ve extracted it in part by the nature of our embodiment that&amp;#39;s been shaped over hundreds of millions of years.</text><text start="4997.8" dur="5.78">We see the infinite plain of facts and we impose a moral interpretation on it.</text><text start="5003.58" dur="3.96">And the moral interpretation is what to do about what is.</text><text start="5008" dur="4.9">And that&amp;#39;s associated both with security because you just don&amp;#39;t need too much complexity,</text><text start="5013.04" dur="1.2">And also with aim.</text><text start="5014.34" dur="1.8">And so we&amp;#39;re mobile creatures, right?</text><text start="5016.14" dur="1.8">We need to know where we&amp;#39;re going.</text><text start="5017.94" dur="4.84">Because all we&amp;#39;re ever concerned about, roughly speaking, is where we&amp;#39;re going.</text><text start="5022.96" dur="1.4">That&amp;#39;s what we need to know.</text><text start="5024.36" dur="2.12">Where are we going, what are we doing, and why?</text><text start="5027.04" dur="4.22">And that&amp;#39;s not the same question as what is the world made of objectively.</text><text start="5031.56" dur="2.28">It&amp;#39;s a different question and requires different answers.</text><text start="5034.72" dur="4.54">And so that&amp;#39;s the domain of the moral, as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, which is what are you aiming at?</text><text start="5039.92" dur="2.76">And that&amp;#39;s the question of the ultimate ideal, in some sense.</text><text start="5042.76" dur="9.8">Even if you have trivial little fragmentary ideals, there&amp;#39;s something trying to emerge out of that that&amp;#39;s more coherent and more

There&amp;#39;s four sources, in the Old Testament, or the Hebrew Bible.</text><text start="5817.92" dur="1.78">Four stories that we know came together.</text><text start="5819.98" dur="2.88">One source was called the Priestly.</text><text start="5823.08" dur="3.36">And it used the name Elohim or El Shaddai for God.</text><text start="5826.68" dur="3.52">And I believe El is the root word for Allah, as well.</text><text start="5832.16" dur="8.92">And that&amp;#39;s usually translated as God or the gods, because Elohim is utilized as plural in the beginning books of the Bible.</text><text start="5841.32" dur="2.68">And it&amp;#39;s newer that the Jahwist version.</text><text start="5844" dur="6.48">Now, the reason I&amp;#39;m telling you that is because Genesis 1, which is the first story, isn&amp;#39;t as old as Genesis 2.</text><text start="5850.48" dur="5.42">Genesis 2 contains, the Jahwist version, for example, contains the story of Adam and Eve.</text><text start="5856.28" dur="2.48">And that&amp;#39;s older than the very first book in the Bible.</text><text start="5859.16" dur="2.72">But they decided to put the newer version first.</text><text start="5862.24" dur="5.1">And I think it&amp;#39;s because it deals with more fundamental abstractions. It&amp;#39;s something like that.</text><text start="5867.38" dur="8.52">It&amp;#39;s like, it deals with the most basic of abstractions, how the universe was created, and then segues into what the human environment is like.</text><text start="5876.44" dur="1.94">And so that seems to be the logic behind it.</text><text start="5880.38" dur="8.02">The Jahwist version uses the name YHWH, which apparently people didn&amp;#39;t say, but we believe was pronounced something like &amp;quot;Yahweh.&amp;quot;</text><text start="5889.48" dur="5.38">And it has a strongly anthropomorphic God, so one that takes human form.</text><text start="5895.16" dur="1.84">It begins with Genesis 2:4.</text><text start="5897.2" dur="9.88">This is the account of the heavens and the earth when, and it contains the story of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, and Noah, and the Tower of Babel, and Exodus, and Numbers, along with the priestly version.</text><text start="5907.3" dur="8.04">It also contains the form, just the form, of the Ten Commandments, which is like a truncated form of the law.</text><text start="5918.34" dur="4.48">The Elohist source contains the stories of Abraham and Isaac.</text><text start="5923.3" dur="3.34">It&amp;#39;s concerned with the heavenly hierarchy that includes angels.</text><text start="5926.64" dur="1.98">It talks about the departure from Egypt.</text><text start="5928.92" dur="6.42">And it presents the Covenant Code, which is this idea that society is predicated (this was Israeli society),</text><text start="5935.34" dur="5.84">was predicated on a covenant with God, and that&amp;#39;s laid out in a sequence of rules, some of which are the Ten Commandments,</text><text start="5941.18" dur="2.9">but many of which are much more extensive than that.</text><text start="5944.6" dur="7.6">And then the final one is the Deuteronomist code, and it contains the bulk of the law, and the Deuteronomic history.</text><text start="5952.2" dur="4.06">And it&amp;#39;s independent of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers.</text><text start="5956.48" dur="8.14">And so we know that at least for, now there&amp;#39;s debate  about this, like there is about everything, so I&amp;#39;m brushing over a very large area of scholarship,</text><text start="5964.62" dur="10">but people generally assume that there were multiple authors over multiple periods of time, and the way they concluded that is by looking at textual analysis, you know?</text><text start="5974.74" dur="6.18">Trying to see where there are chunks of the stories that have the same kind of style or the same referents.</text><text start="5980.92" dur="5.4">And people argue about that because, you know, obviously it&amp;#39;s difficult to recreate something ancient.</text><text start="5986.42" dur="2.5">But that&amp;#39;s the basic idea.</text><text start="5989.12" dur="4.66">So it is an amalgam of viewpoints about these initial issues.</text><text start="5993.78" dur="1.6">And that&amp;#39;s important to know.</text><text start="5995.6" dur="3.18">So it&amp;#39;s like a collective story.</text><text start="6001.88" dur="3.44">Okay, now, to understand the first part of Genesis,</text><text start="6006.26" dur="1.12">I&amp;#39;m going to turn,</text><text start="6009.46" dur="2.42">strangely enough, to</text><text start="6013.82" dur="5.24">something that&amp;#39;s actually part of the New Testament, and this is a central element of Christianity.</text><text start="6019.66" dur="4.4">And it&amp;#39;s a very strange idea and it&amp;#39;s going to take a very long time to unpack.</text><text start="6024.06" dur="5.92">But the idea, this is what John said about Christ, he said &amp;quot;in the beginning was the Word.&amp;quot;</text><text start="6030.04" dur="6.8">So that relates back to Genesis 1, &amp;quot;in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&amp;quot;</text><text start="6037.46" dur="8.16">That&amp;#39;s some, well, three sentences like that take a lot of unpacking because, well none of that seems to make any sense whatsoever, really, right?</text><text start="6045.62" dur="4.46">In the beginning was the word. And, the word was both with God. And, the word was God.</text><text start="6050.84" dur="3">So, the first question might be, what in the world does that mean?</text><text start="6054.3" dur="3.02">In the beginning was the word, that&amp;#39;s the logos actually.</text><text start="6058.22" dur="6.1">And the logos is embodied in the figure of Christ. So there&amp;#39;s this idea in John that whatever Christ is, the son of God,</text><text start="6064.7" dur="6.92">is not only instantiated in history, say, at a particular time and place, as a carpenter in some backwoods part of the world,</text><text start="6071.78" dur="1.66">but also, something eternal</text><text start="6073.76" dur="3.82">that exists up, outside of time and space, that was there right at the beginning.</text><text start="6078.14" dur="4.6">And as far as I can tell, what that logos represents is something like modern people,</text><text start="6083.04" dur="4.2">something like what modern people refer to when they talk about consciousness.</text><text start="6087.64" dur="7.4">It&amp;#39;s something like that. It&amp;#39;s more than that. It&amp;#39;s like consciousness and its capacity to be aware and its capacity to communicate.</text><text start="6095.46" dur="7.68">It&amp;#39;s something like that, and there&amp;#39;s an idea underneath that, which is that being, especially from a phenomenological perspective, so the being that is experience,</text><text start="6103.14" dur="2.02">can not exist without consciousness.</text><text start="6105.6" dur="4.38">It&amp;#39;s like consciousness shines a light on things to bring it into being.</text><text start="6110.14" dur="3.32">Because without consciousness, what is there?</text><text start="6113.86" dur="1.6">No one experiences anything.</text><text start="6116.08" dur="3.08">Is there anything when no one experiences anything?</text><text start="6119.22" dur="1.28">That&amp;#39;s the question.</text><text start="6120.68" dur="7.44">And the answer that this book is presenting is that, no, you have to think about consciousness as a constituent element of reality.</text><text start="6128.12" dur="4.46">It&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s necessary for reality itself to exist.</text><text start="6132.8" dur="2.78">Now, of course, it depends on what you mean by reality.</text><text start="6136.1" dur="7">But, the reality that&amp;#39;s being referred to here, I told you already, is the strange amalgam of the subjective experience and the world.</text><text start="6143.24" dur="7.64">But the question is deeper than that too, because it is by no means obvious what there is if there&amp;#39;s no one to experience it.</text><text start="6151" dur="5.76">I mean the whole notion of time itself seems to collapse, at least in terms of something like felt duration.</text><text start="6156.9" dur="5.76">And the notion of size disappears, essentially, because there&amp;#39;s nothing to scale it.</text><text start="6163" dur="1.84">Causality seems to vanish.</text><text start="6167.02" dur="3.02">We don&amp;#39;t understand consciousness. Not in the least.</text><text start="6170.54" dur="5.12">We don&amp;#39;t understand what it is that is in us that gives illumination to being.</text><text start="6175.66" dur="6.22">And what happens in the Old Testament, at least in part, is that that consciousness is associated with the divine.</text><text start="6182.5" dur="3.68">Now you think, well, is that a reasonable proposition?</text><text start="6187.06" dur="5.36">That&amp;#39;s a very complicated question, but at least we might know that there&amp;#39;s something to the claim.</text><text start="6193" dur="5">Because there is a miracle of experience and existence that&amp;#39;s dependent on consciousness.</text><text start="6198" dur="4.42">I mean, people try to explain it away constantly, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work very well.</text><text start="6202.42" dur="4.16">And here&amp;#39;s something else to think about, I think, that&amp;#39;s really worth thinking about.</text><text start="6206.58" dur="3.74">People do not like it when you treat them like they&amp;#39;re not conscious.</text><text start="6211" dur="2.08">Right? They react very badly to that.</text><text start="6213.74" dur="3.14">And you don&amp;#39;t like it if someone assumes that you&amp;#39;re not conscious,</text><text start="6216.88" dur="3.3">and you don&amp;#39;t like it if someone assumes that you don&amp;#39;t have free will.</text><text start="6220.44" dur="6.38">You know, that you&amp;#39;re just absolutely determined in your actions, and there&amp;#39;s nothing that&amp;#39;s going to repair you.</text><text start="6226.82" dur="2.6">And that you don&amp;#39;t need to have any responsibility for your actions.</text><text start="6229.42" dur="6.68">It&amp;#39;s like our culture, the laws of our culture, are predicated on the idea, something like, people are conscious,</text><text start="6236.1" dur="6.7">people have experience, people make decisions and can be held responsible for them, if there&amp;#39;s a free will element to it.</text><text start="6242.8" dur="3.4">And you can debate all that philosophically, and fine.</text><text start="6246.2" dur="6.1">But the point is that that is how we act and that is the ideal that our legal system is predicated on.</text><text start="6252.64" dur="5.6">And there&amp;#39;s something deep about it, because you&amp;#39;re a subject to the law.</text><text start="6259.06" dur="2.64">But the law is also limited by you.</text><text start="6261.96" dur="6.08">Which is to say that in a well-functioning, properly-grounded democratic system,</text><text start="6268.42" dur="3.26">you have intrinsic value.</text><text start="6272.12" dur="3.6">That&amp;#39;s the source of your rights, even if you&amp;#39;re a murderer.</text><text start="6276.08" dur="5.22">We have to say, the law can only go so far because there&amp;#39;s something about you that&amp;#39;s divine.</text><text start="6281.78" dur="1.32">Well, what does that mean?</text><text start="6283.1" dur="6.88">Well, partly it means that there&amp;#39;s something about you that&amp;#39;s conscious and capable of communicating, like you&amp;#39;re a whole world unto yourself.</text><text start="6290.48" dur="3.26">And you have that to contribute to everyone else and that&amp;#39;s valuable.</text><text start="6293.74" dur="7">That you can learn new things, you can transform the structure of society, you can invent a new way of dealing with the world.</text><text start="6301.02" dur="1.36">You&amp;#39;re capable of all that.</text><text start="6302.38" dur="3.42">It&amp;#39;s an intrinsic part of you, and that&amp;#39;s associated with this.</text><text start="6306.84" dur="4.4">That&amp;#39;s the idea there, is that there&amp;#39;s something about the logos</text><text start="6312.9" dur="8.12">that is necessary for the absolute chaos of the reality beyond experience to manifest itself as reality.</text><text start="6321.54" dur="6">That&amp;#39;s an amazing idea because it gives consciousness a constitutive role in the cosmos.</text><text start="6328.04" dur="4.6">And you can debate that, but, you know, you can&amp;#39;t just bloody well brush it off.</text><text start="6333.36" dur="7.42">Because, first of all, we are the most complicated things there are that we know of, by a massive amount.</text><text start="6340.78" dur="2.28">We&amp;#39;re so complicated that it&amp;#39;s unbelievable.</text><text start="6343.4" dur="4.98">And so, you know, there&amp;#39;s a lot of cosmos out there, but there&amp;#39;s a lot of cosmos in here too.</text><text start="6348.6" dur="8.2">And which one is greater is by no means obvious, unless you use something trivial, like relative size, which, you know, really isn&amp;#39;t a very sophisticated approach.</text><text start="6357.28" dur="8.16">And whatever it is that is you has this capacity to experience reality and to transform it, which is a very strange thing, you know?</text><text start="6365.44" dur="3.48">You can conceptualize a future, in your imagination.</text><text start="6368.98" dur="2.62">And then you can work and make that manifest.</text><text start="6371.88" dur="2.42">You participate in the process of creation.</text><text start="6374.58" dur="1.42">That&amp;#39;s one way of thinking about it.</text><text start="6376.52" dur="8.72">And so that&amp;#39;s why I think, in Genesis 1, it relates the idea that human beings are made in the image of the divine, men and women,</text><text start="6385.34" dur="9.7">which is interesting too, because the feminists are always criticizing Christianity, for example, as being inexorably patriarchal.</text><text start="6396.6" dur="4.28">Of course, they criticize everything like that [LAUGHTER], so it&amp;#39;s hardly a stroke of bloody brilliance.</text><text start="6401.16" dur="8.16">But I think it&amp;#39;s an absolute miracle that right at the beginning of the document, it says straightforwardly, with no hesitation whatsoever,</text><text start="6409.32" dur="8.26">that the divine spark, which we&amp;#39;re associating with the word that brings forth being, is manifest in men and women equally.</text><text start="6417.92" dur="1.3">That&amp;#39;s a very cool thing.</text><text start="6419.46" dur="4.14">And you&amp;#39;ve gotta think, like I said, you actually take that seriously.</text><text start="6423.6" dur="3.74">Well, what you&amp;#39;ve got to ask is, what happens if you don&amp;#39;t take it seriously?</text><text start="6427.82" dur="0.5">Right?</text><text start="6429.32" dur="2.88">Read Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Crime and Punishment.&amp;quot;</text><text start="6432.62" dur="1.04">That&amp;#39;s the best...</text><text start="6435.24" dur="4.96">the best investigation of that tactic that&amp;#39;s ever been produced</text><text start="6440.32" dur="6.28">Because what happens in Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Crime and Punishment&amp;quot; is that the main character, whose name is Raskolnikov,</text><text start="6446.6" dur="3.1">decides that there&amp;#39;s no intrinsic value to other people.</text><text start="6450.04" dur="2.1">And that as a consequence, he can do whatever he wants.</text><text start="6452.14" dur="2.34">It&amp;#39;s only cowardice that stops him from acting.</text><text start="6454.96" dur="7">Right? Because, well, why would it be anything else if the value of other people is just an arbitrary superstition?</text><text start="6462.22" dur="2.36">Then why can&amp;#39;t I do exactly what I want, when I want?</text><text start="6465.1" dur="1.7">Which is the psychopath&amp;#39;s viewpoint.</text><text start="6467.18" dur="5.6">Well, so Roskolnikov does. He kills someone who&amp;#39;s a very horrible person, and he has very good reasons for killing her.</text><text start="6472.78" dur="5.48">He&amp;#39;s half starved and a little bit insane, and possessed by this ideology, it&amp;#39;s a brilliant, brilliant layout.</text><text start="6478.68" dur="9.44">And he finds out something after he kills her, which is that the post-killing Raskolnikov and the pre-killing Raskolnikov are not the same person, even a little bit.</text><text start="6488.3" dur="4.52">Because he&amp;#39;s broken a rule, like he&amp;#39;s broken a serious rule, and there&amp;#39;s no going back.</text><text start="6493.1" dur="10.2">And &amp;quot;Crime and Punishment&amp;quot; is the best investigation I know of, of what happens if you take the notion that there&amp;#39;s nothing divine about the individual seriously.</text><text start="6503.7" dur="0.72">Now you...</text><text start="6506.86" dur="8.88">Most of the people I know who are deeply atheistic, and I understand why they&amp;#39;re deeply atheistic, they haven&amp;#39;t contended with people like Dostoevsky.</text><text start="6515.74" dur="1.26">Not as far as I can tell.</text><text start="6517.38" dur="2.9">Because I don&amp;#39;t see logical flaws in &amp;quot;Crime and Punishment.&amp;quot;</text><text start="6520.28" dur="2">I think he got the psychology exactly right.</text><text start="6522.66" dur="2.9">Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s amazing for this because</text><text start="6525.76" dur="2.24">in one of his books, &amp;quot;The Devils,&amp;quot; for example,</text><text start="6528.52" dur="4.84">he describes a political scenario that&amp;#39;s not much different than the one we find ourselves in now.</text><text start="6533.7" dur="4.74">And there are these people who are possessed by rationalistic, utopian, atheistic ideas.</text><text start="6538.66" dur="3.08">They&amp;#39;re very powerful.

just got our act together and beautified things, that that&amp;#39;s the place the we could inhabit.</text><text start="7465.86" dur="5.98">And that would ennoble us, and that&amp;#39;s why Jerusalem, the heavenly city, is paved with gemstones, you know?</text><text start="7471.84" dur="5.98">They&amp;#39;re crystalline, they emit light, it&amp;#39;s the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness.</text><text start="7477.82" dur="3.24">Beauty is the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness.</text><text start="7481.18" dur="4.8">And we ignore it at our spiritual and economic peril.</text><text start="7486" dur="5.2">It&amp;#39;s obvious that beauty, there&amp;#39;s almost nothing more valuable than beauty.</text><text start="7491.88" dur="1.38">Economically, practically, right?</text><text start="7493.42" dur="1.16">So, yeah.</text><text start="7495.52" dur="4.4">Why that is, who knows?</text><text start="7500.86" dur="0.64">You know?</text><text start="7501.94" dur="4.9">Why we experience gemstones, for example, as beautiful, it&amp;#39;s very mysterious.</text><text start="7507.32" dur="1.22">There&amp;#39;re deep reasons for it.</text><text start="7511.38" dur="4.88">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="7516.26" dur="0.5">Hi.</text><text start="7517.24" dur="1.94">I have a bit of a similar question, actually.</text><text start="7519.2" dur="9.46">I know that one of the ways in which the Bible is appreciated, even by some of its harshest critics and deeply atheistic people,</text><text start="7528.8" dur="7.36">is as a work of literature and as something, at least the King James authorized translation of the Bible, as something very aesthetically beautiful.</text><text start="7536.16" dur="3.24">And a great work of literature and a great work of poetry.</text><text start="7539.54" dur="14.16">And I&amp;#39;m wondering, just from your study of it, and from your personal perspective, if there&amp;#39;s any particular passages or parts of it that have struck you that way, or that you cherish more than any others, that you would be able to share.</text><text start="7553.86" dur="5.92">Well the ones that have really opened up to me, I think, are the stories in Genesis.</text><text start="7560.36" dur="8.14">Right up to the Tower of Babel, because I think, well, and hopefully I&amp;#39;ll talk to all of you about that, but I think I&amp;#39;ve got some sense of what they mean and why.</text><text start="7568.72" dur="2.88">I know it&amp;#39;s not exhaustive, obviously, but</text><text start="7572.28" dur="2.18">the story in Exodus as well.</text><text start="7574.46" dur="2.7">I also feel like I&amp;#39;ve got a handle on that.</text><text start="7577.46" dur="2.96">And so those have hit me really, really hard.</text><text start="7580.52" dur="6.94">And just trying to understand this first part of Genesis, to try to understand what these concepts mean has been</text><text start="7587.74" dur="9.2">Especially when I started to understand that the concept that human beings are made in God&amp;#39;s image, that God has all those attributes that we just described,</text><text start="7597.3" dur="7">that human beings are made in God&amp;#39;s image, that that&amp;#39;s actually the cornerstone of our legal system, that really rattled me.</text><text start="7604.3" dur="10">Because I didn&amp;#39;t understand that clearly, that our body of laws has that metaphysical presupposition, without which the laws fall apart.</text><text start="7614.3" dur="1.8">And that&amp;#39;s starting to happen, it really is.</text><text start="7616.1" dur="2.28">You know, like the post-modern critique of law.</text><text start="7618.48" dur="10.8">The law schools are, I would say, they&amp;#39;re overrun by post-modernists who are undermining the structure of Western law as fast as they possibly can because they don&amp;#39;t buy any of this.</text><text start="7629.42" dur="9.56">And so they&amp;#39;re much more likely to just think of the law as something, like a casual pragmatic tool to be manipulated for the purposes of bringing forth the utopia.</text><text start="7639.18" dur="2.96">It&amp;#39;s a really, really, really bad idea.</text><text start="7642.76" dur="6.36">So it&amp;#39;s very strange to me that we go off track when that metaphysical foundation starts to get rattled.</text><text start="7649.24" dur="7.4">Do you think your appreciation of the aesthetic beauty of it comes from a belief in the truth in the underlying proposition?</text><text start="7656.68" dur="16.7">I mean, that&amp;#39;s, because even the atheistic critics that I&amp;#39;m thinking of, like, even Dawkins or Hitchens, really appreciate the Bible as just a piece of really beautiful literature and just the quality of the writing, even if they totally reject the premise of it.</text><text start="7673.56" dur="14.28">Yeah, well I don&amp;#39;t think that you can see it as beautiful and poetic AND reject the underlying premises because if you see it as beautiful and poetic, you&amp;#39;re accepting the underlying premises with your experience of the beauty and the poetics,</text><text start="7687.84" dur="3.8">even though you may be fighting it with your articulated rationality.</text><text start="7691.9" dur="5.02">So I that indicates is a dis-integrated perspective on the book.</text><text start="7697.1" dur="9.52">And it&amp;#39;s not surprising that that&amp;#39;s the case, it&amp;#39;s the perspective that everyone has on the book, except with them it&amp;#39;s more well-developed and well-thought-through.</text><text start="7707.04" dur="2.04">But I think it&amp;#39;s fundamentally...</text><text start="7709.5" dur="4.26">They&amp;#39;re not approaching the thing with enough respect, that&amp;#39;s my sense.</text><text start="7714.12" dur="2.66">And who knows, right? I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="7716.78" dur="4.34">But what I&amp;#39;ve tried to do is to think there&amp;#39;s probably more to this than I know.</text><text start="7721.92" dur="8.38">And then tried to understand it from that perspective, rather than to think, for example, well, it&amp;#39;s a collection of superstitions that we&amp;#39;ve somehow outgrown.</text><text start="7730.38" dur="4.92">It&amp;#39;s like, no, sorry, that&amp;#39;s not a deep enough analysis.</text><text start="7735.82" dur="10.52">Because it&amp;#39;s got some truth, but it doesn&amp;#39;t take into account the fact that the propositions still stand at the foundation of our culture.</text><text start="7746.56" dur="6.58">It doesn&amp;#39;t address Nietzsche&amp;#39;s central concern, which is that if you blow out the notion of God, the entire structure crumbles.</text><text start="7753.78" dur="7.72">You can debate that, fine. But I&amp;#39;d just as soon that you debated it with Nietzsche, because he&amp;#39;s a pretty tough customer to tangle with.</text><text start="7762.02" dur="7.44">I don&amp;#39;t think the atheist types, insofar as there&amp;#39;s a type, I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ve wrestled with the real problems.</text><text start="7770.86" dur="0.5">Yeah.</text><text start="7772.8" dur="5.3">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="7778.1" dur="6.12">So I appreciate you set up some ground rules to keep things rational, and I think that&amp;#39;s going to help us.</text><text start="7784.36" dur="10.28">What I&amp;#39;m wondering is, so for instance, you said elsewhere, the New Testament, from what you can see, it&amp;#39;s psychologically correct.</text><text start="7794.78" dur="7.36">And that&amp;#39;s quite astounding, I would say. There&amp;#39;s a lot of truth in your depiction to these stories, elsewhere.</text><text start="7802.28" dur="4">You&amp;#39;ve pointed out deep truths, real powerful.</text><text start="7806.64" dur="14.38">So what my question would be is if we can say Nietzsche took an order of magnitude of intelligence and depth to be able to predict what would happen in the next century,</text><text start="7821.26" dur="6.4">rationally, if the Bible&amp;#39;s not the inerrant word of God, what&amp;#39;s going on?</text><text start="7828.16" dur="1.6">That&amp;#39;s a good question.</text><text start="7829.76" dur="4.4">That&amp;#39;s a really good question, and I&amp;#39;m going to try that rationally.</text><text start="7834.38" dur="10.24">But, as I said, I don&amp;#39;t want to leave people with the notion, because you know, some ways, this is something I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about a long time,</text><text start="7844.62" dur="5.9">is I can&amp;#39;t tell if I&amp;#39;m an advocate of the religious viewpoint or its worst possible critic.</text><text start="7850.92" dur="4.8">Because I am doing my best to make it rational, and there&amp;#39;s a reductionistic element to that.</text><text start="7855.72" dur="5.2">But I think that I&amp;#39;m doing that while also leaving the door open to things that I don&amp;#39;t understand.</text><text start="7860.92" dur="5.12">Because that there&amp;#39;s more to this story than I understand or can understand.</text><text start="7866.06" dur="8.38">And I&amp;#39;m laying out what I can understand and I&amp;#39;m making it rational, but I do not believe for an instant that that exhausts the realm.</text><text start="7874.48" dur="7">It&amp;#39;s like there are ways of interpreting these stories that work in the conceptual universe we inhabit right now.</text><text start="7881.94" dur="2.7">But there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that we don&amp;#39;t understand.</text><text start="7884.64" dur="5.28">One thing I found about digging into these stories is that the deeper you dig, the more you find.</text><text start="7889.92" dur="5.28">And that&amp;#39;s one of the things that convinced me that there was more to them than I had originally suspected.</text><text start="7895.2" dur="4.56">Because things would click, and I&amp;#39;d think, wow, that&amp;#39;s really something.</text><text start="7899.76" dur="6.46">And then I would take it apart further, and I&amp;#39;d think, oh, well, I thought THAT was something, but this is even more remarkable.</text><text start="7906.22" dur="1.86">It just keeps opening and opening.</text><text start="7908.1" dur="10.62">So I&amp;#39;m gonna make it rational. I&amp;#39;m going to try to provide an answer to, and I think you&amp;#39;re right about speaking about Nietzsche and his capacity for prophecy, and Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s in the same category.</text><text start="7919.02" dur="7">It&amp;#39;s like there are prophetic elements to the Old and New Testament that seem to stretch over much vaster spans of time.</text><text start="7926.38" dur="3.02">And I&amp;#39;m going to try to produce a rational account of that.</text><text start="7929.56" dur="10.38">But, I mean, one of the reasons that I think the New Testament is &amp;quot;psychologically true,&amp;quot; let&amp;#39;s say, is because, and this is one of the things that&amp;#39;s deeply embedded in the structure of the Bible.</text><text start="7940.02" dur="8.64">In the Old Testament, there&amp;#39;s this idea, and I&amp;#39;m skipping ahead, that through a succession of states,</text><text start="7948.76" dur="5.12">the people who behave properly will eventually establish the proper state.</text><text start="7953.92" dur="4.56">And so the state is viewed, in some sense, as the entity of salvation.</text><text start="7959.2" dur="4.94">But what happens in the New Testament is that idea gets, you could say, deconstructed.</text><text start="7964.48" dur="7.6">And instead of a state being the place of redemption, a state of being becomes the test of redemption.</text><text start="7972.22" dur="9.5">And so the idea that human beings will be redeemed moves from the utopian state vision to the responsibility of the individual.</text><text start="7981.92" dur="1.5">And I think that&amp;#39;s correct.</text><text start="7983.5" dur="8.34">I believe that that&amp;#39;s the right answer, and I think that the West, in particular, is predicated on that idea.</text><text start="7991.84" dur="3.72">Because it makes the state subservient to the individual.</text><text start="7995.78" dur="9.62">I mean there&amp;#39;s a continual dialogue, but in the final analysis the locus of the divine is the individual and not the state.</text><text start="8005.5" dur="7.12">And I believe that&amp;#39;s so true that if we don&amp;#39;t act it out and believe it, then we all die painfully.</text><text start="8012.62" dur="1.68">And that&amp;#39;s true enough for me.</text><text start="8014.52" dur="0.5">So.</text><text start="8015.98" dur="5.28">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="8021.34" dur="2.2">I thank you for the illuminating talk.</text><text start="8023.86" dur="8.3">I&amp;#39;m going to keep you on the creation story, and if you don&amp;#39;t mind, because we know this editing that was done, there was a purpose for the editing.</text><text start="8032.3" dur="12.88">Can you give us your thoughts about the differences in the story of creation, especially pertaining to man, from the first chapter, which is very God-like, you know, by a word?</text><text start="8045.26" dur="5.1">And to the second one, which is more like a fatherly type of creation.</text><text start="8050.38" dur="6.28">Is it the selling point? What was the reason for this type of editing to put the two together, one of them?</text><text start="8056.74" dur="17.4">Well, I think that the more cynical criticisms of the Bible and the religious tradition, for instances like Marxists or Freudsian, for that matter, make the case that it&amp;#39;s a manifestation of power and politics.</text><text start="8074.68" dur="4.82">And that there&amp;#39;s always a political or economic motivation behind the construction of the stories.</text><text start="8079.5" dur="2.46">And I think that that&amp;#39;s true to some degree.</text><text start="8082.22" dur="7.38">But I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s true enough so that you can take that particular interpretive tack and be done with it.</text><text start="8090.1" dur="8.64">And I would say that to the degree that there are political and economic motivations that have shaped the stories, the fact that multiple stories have come together,</text><text start="8098.84" dur="11.4">they&amp;#39;re sort of corrective in some sense, and so even if at the level of detail, there&amp;#39;s political intrigue and politics, say, with regards to the ascendancy of Israel,</text><text start="8111.22" dur="4.68">when you step away from it, it becomes something that&amp;#39;s more universal and escapes from that.</text><text start="8116" dur="3.68">And how that happened, I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="8119.86" dur="6.7">I mean, I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say, it&amp;#39;s reasonably safe to say that the people who put this document together, they did two things.</text><text start="8126.56" dur="4.42">I think they were guided by their aesthetic taste and their conscience.</text><text start="8130.98" dur="1.44">I truly believe that.</text><text start="8132.42" dur="6.48">And the reason I believe that is because I think anything that was propagandistic would have been forgotten.</text><text start="8139.58" dur="1.8">Because you can&amp;#39;t remember propaganda.</text><text start="8141.74" dur="3.84">No one likes it, it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s dead ten years after you write it, or twenty years.</text><text start="8145.58" dur="6.04">And it isn&amp;#39;t only that these books were assembled and written, it was that they were preserved and remembered.</text><text start="8151.62" dur="3.72">And to me that means they have an affinity with the structure of memory.</text><text start="8155.34" dur="5.66">I mean, you think about it. How does the story last ten thousand years unless it&amp;#39;s the kind of story you can remember?</text><text start="8161" dur="2.94">It doesn&amp;#39;t, because you forget all the forgettable stuff.</text><text start="8163.94" dur="2.16">And all you remember is the memorable stuff.</text><text start="8166.32" dur="9.46">And so there&amp;#39;s this interplay between the document itself and its audience that shapes the document.</text><text start="8177.88" dur="3.3">Now, I don&amp;#39;t know how specifically I answered your question.</text><text start="8182.7" dur="8.1">We&amp;#39;re going to hit the different stories as they come up in sequence and I think I&amp;#39;ll shed some more light on the relationship between them doing that.</text><text start="8190.8" dur="1.68">And we&amp;#39;ll start with that next week.</text><text start="8195.34" dur="3.38">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="8198.86" dur="9.14">Right, so um I&amp;#39;ve been really interested in a lot of the stuff that you&amp;#39;ve been saying about dreams because I&amp;#39;ve been lucid dreaming a lot for many years.</text><text start="8208" dur="4.4">But always in a sort of atheistic way, as sort of like a game or something like that.</text><text start="8212.66" dur="13.1">But because of seeing your talks and everything, I&amp;#39;ve started to think of it from a different perspective, like you&amp;#39;re now interfacing with something beyond the narrow scope of your conscious awareness, or something like that.</text><text start="8225.82" dur="2">Maybe mythological or something like God.</text><text start="8228.02" dur="15.06">And so what I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about, and what I&amp;#39;ve maybe wondered what you&amp;#39;d think about, is that, in some ways, when you&amp;#39;re lucid dreaming, you&amp;#39;re getting beyond the limitations of a normal dreamer, sort of transcending limitations,</text><text start="8243.12" dur="4.46">which maybe is not the purpose of people, right?</text><text start="8247.58" dur="5.5">Because as a person, you&amp;#39;re supposed to be limited in some ways, as opposed to God, who&amp;#39;s not limited.</text><text start="8253.2" dur="8.14">And how, but on the other hand, it&amp;#39;s a good opportunity to kind of have control over your interactions with this very special, interesting thing.</text><text start="8261.46" dur="7.32">So I guess the conundrum is that on one hand, you can control your interactions, but on the other hand, you ARE controlling them.</text><text start="8268.78" dur="6.66">So I guess I&amp;#39;m wondering what you think about that, and also just in general what do you think about lucid dreaming as a thing, like, should you do it?</text><text start="8275.44" dur="2.4">I had a client who could really lucid dream, you know?</text><text start="8278.38" dur="5.7">And one of the things, she used them now and then to solve problems, even though she didn&amp;#39;t always pay attention to the answer.</text><text start="8284.3" dur="1.04">Sometimes she did.</text><text start="8286.74" dur="7.3">In one of her dreams, one of the characters told her that she would have to learn to live with a slaughterhouse.</text><text start="8294.48" dur="5.64">She was very afraid of life, and one of the consequences of that was that we went and watched them bombing.</text><text start="8300.82" dur="6.02">So but one of the things she did, she&amp;#39;d ask the characters what they were up to, you know?</text><text start="8306.88" dur="2.86">She was, instead of controlling, she would inquire.</text><text start="8310.4" dur="3.76">And so but I don&amp;#39;t know what to say about lucid dreaming beyond that.</text><text start="8314.16" dur="6.88">I know it&amp;#39;s a well-documented phenomena and many people can do it, and women seem to be able to do it better than men, that&amp;#39;s what the research indicates.</text><text start="8321.32" dur="4.6">But I think that what we don&amp;#39;t know about lucid dreaming could fill a lot of books.</text><text start="8326.42" dur="8.96">So, I think there is some danger in controlling it, because you lose the spontaneous revelation, although not completely because you can&amp;#39;t control it completely.</text><text start="8337.04" dur="4.8">You might be interested in reading Jung&amp;#39;s books on active imagination.</text><text start="8342.14" dur="2.7">Because he kind of learned to dream when he was awake.</text><text start="8345.48" dur="6.48">And he spent a lot of time in the world of imagination when he was awake, the Red Books, for example.</text><text start="8351.98" dur="4.76">Red Book is a document of his experiences with awake dreaming.</text><text start="8356.74" dur="6.86">But he was very interactive with the dream, you know, instead of trying to bend it to his whim or his will.</text><text start="8363.6" dur="4.46">He was exploring it, in some sense, like you&amp;#39;d explore a video game.</text><text start="8368.76" dur="2.82">Which are forms of dreams in and of themselves.</text><text start="8372.8" dur="3.92">Yeah, I would say do it with an exploratory purpose in mind.</text><text start="8376.72" dur="4.78">You could always ask yourself what you could learn, too, which is a very dangerous question to ask a dream.</text><text start="8381.5" dur="2.66">Because sometimes you&amp;#39;ll find out what you have to learn.</text><text start="8384.18" dur="1.36">That&amp;#39;s not so pleasant.</text><text start="8385.54" dur="1.74">But it&amp;#39;s really worthwhile.</text><text start="8389.5" dur="3.72">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="8393.3" dur="10.18">Okay, so I think I&amp;#39;m going to take four more questions, only, because I&amp;#39;m running out of brain, and I don&amp;#39;t want to say stupid things, or stupider things than I&amp;#39;ve already said, so.</text><text start="8405.1" dur="1.68">Yeah, thank you for the talk.</text><text start="8406.92" dur="11.58">So in the beginning of your lecture, you talked about how society need this kind of dream-like religious base so we don&amp;#39;t go between left and right violently, and we can kind of have this base.</text><text start="8418.52" dur="9.44">And then you also said you admired Nietzsche for kind of chopping down these ideological and kind of dogmatic needs coming up from

You&amp;#39;re not running around out there out in the world, investigating.</text><text start="8957.48" dur="6.64">So it&amp;#39;s part of the manner in which your brain experiments with the way the world can be represented.</text><text start="8964.76" dur="3.24">And so it seems absolutely necessary.</text><text start="8968.06" dur="5.12">I mean, if you deprive people of REM sleep, they don&amp;#39;t stay sane very long.</text><text start="8973.38" dur="7.26">There&amp;#39;s something necessary about the dreaming process to maintenance of articulated sanity.</text><text start="8981.08" dur="4.68">So you&amp;#39;re doing some sort of organization at night when you descend into that chaos.</text><text start="8986.08" dur="5.34">Partly what seems to happen is that your categories have boundaries, right?</text><text start="8991.42" dur="2.66">But sometimes you don&amp;#39;t have the categories correct.</text><text start="8994.62" dur="5.32">And so the boundaries have to loosen and other things need to be put into categories with some things shunted away.</text><text start="9000.3" dur="4.48">And in the dream, the category structure loosens, which is why dreams are so peculiar.</text><text start="9005.3" dur="1.54">But they&amp;#39;re experimenting.</text><text start="9006.84" dur="5.42">Your mind is experimenting with the underlying categorical structure of imagination.</text><text start="9012.48" dur="4.28">And trying to update your mode of being in the world.</text><text start="9016.76" dur="3.52">Dreams often concentrate on things that provoke anxiety.</text><text start="9020.28" dur="4.46">So if you wake people up when they&amp;#39;re dreaming, the most commonly reported emotion is anxiety.</text><text start="9025.04" dur="5.28">So the dream is like the first stages of the attempt to contend with the unknown.</text><text start="9030.56" dur="2.7">So the dream is half unknown and half known.</text><text start="9033.26" dur="4.88">Which is also why it&amp;#39;s so peculiar, you know, because you kind of understand it, but you don&amp;#39;t really.</text><text start="9038.34" dur="3.1">And it partakes of the unknown and the known.</text><text start="9041.74" dur="2.88">And it&amp;#39;s the bridge between the two, something like that.</text><text start="9047.46" dur="5.34">[APPLAUSE]</text><text start="9054.06" dur="2.68">Um, okay, so my question is kind of two parts.</text><text start="9056.82" dur="4.12">The first one is just like a general question, and then just the application of the question.</text><text start="9060.94" dur="6.24">So my first question is, do you think that consciousness and being-hood are inextricably linked?</text><text start="9067.42" dur="7.42">And then secondly, so if there something like a super-computer that one could house, theoretically, a perfect brain of a person in it,</text><text start="9074.96" dur="4.72">does that thing then become the same person as the person it was before.</text><text start="9079.68" dur="3.4">So is there a transcendency to being-hood but not to consciousness?</text><text start="9083.16" dur="7.94">Okay, so the first question is, well, I would say that the kind of being that these stories are concerned with is absolutely dependent on consciousness.</text><text start="9091.1" dur="6.04">Now whether or not that means that being as such is dependent on consciousness actually depends on how you define being.</text><text start="9097.68" dur="6.3">So it&amp;#39;s always tricky when you ask is a, here&amp;#39;s an example of meaning.</text><text start="9103.98" dur="3.18">Those are tricky questions because it depends on how you define the two.</text><text start="9107.32" dur="8.1">But for our purposes the being that we&amp;#39;re discussing, that&amp;#39;s represented in these stories, is intrinsically associated with conscious experience.</text><text start="9115.82" dur="9.96">And consciousness is given this constitutive role, the experience that we&amp;#39;re talking about would not exist if consciousness did not exist.</text><text start="9126.18" dur="6.1">So you can think about it as sort of a game, in a way, and then you have to decide for yourself whether that&amp;#39;s a game that can be generalized.</text><text start="9132.28" dur="3.44">And I won&amp;#39;t answer the second part, okay?
